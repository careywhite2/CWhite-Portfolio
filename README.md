Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

 ## About
 Hello, I'm Carey White and I’m a data analyst with a passion for uncovering insights that drive smarter decisions. I’m currently wrapping up my MBA in Business Analytics, where I’ve built a strong foundation in data-driven strategy, statistical analysis, and business intelligence tools. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analytics as an entry-level Business or Data Analyst. 

Along the way, I’ve earned the Google Data Analytics certification and became a Tableau Desktop Specialist, sharpening my skills in SQL, Excel, and Tableau. 
 
My projects reflect both my curiosity and analytical mindset—ranging from comparing R&D investments during COVID-19 to investigating how the NBA’s evolving playstyle may be impacting TV ratings.

I enjoy turning messy datasets into meaningful stories, and I’m always looking to grow, collaborate, and solve interesting problems through data
